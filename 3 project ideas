Idea 1

I'm planning to take raw text and running a sentient analysis to determine if the comments are positive or negative 
Stretch goal: Take the binary outcome (Postive/Negative) and build classifications to determine groupings of these comments (Histogram)
I have survey data from eBay that I will be pulling from our data warehosue 
I chose this topic because this is something that is relevant to my current product and is currently a manual process (interns)

Idea 2 

I would like to determine the likelihood for an animal to get adopted in an animal shelter 
I will likely scrape the data from the SPCA website or obtain data from Auburn University 
This is important to me becuase my fiancee is a fourth year verterinary student. We often have a difficult time talking about my work interests
because it is over her head and she does not understand it. This would be an awesome way to demonstrate what I do to her, as well as 
provide the shelter she works for a valuable tool to monitor their intake/adoption rate 

Idea 3

I would like to build a model that predicts sales forecats baesd on historical sales trends
The data would be obtained from the ebay data warehosue 
I find this intersting becuase my product team struggles with accurate forecasting and has almost given up on doing so. This will allow me the opportunity 
to bring analtical rigor back into the forecasting process
